  "readme": "Steam Server Status library\n=========================\n\nHow to get it\n-------------\n\nThe easiest way to get it is via [npm]\n\n    npm install steam-server-status\n\nIf you want to run the latest version (i.e. later than the version available\nvia [npm]) you can clone this repo, then use [npm] to link-install it:\n\n    npm link /path/to/your/clone\n\nOf course, you can just clone this, and manually point at the library itself,\nbut I really recommend using [npm]!\n\nHow to use it\n-------------\n\nThe library provides basic functionality for requesting the status and statistics of a steam source engine game. The simplest use case you just make a call like this:\n\n    var steamServerStatus = require(steam-server-status');\n    steamServerStatus.getServerStatus(\n        'tf.bonta-kun.net', 27015, function(serverInfo) {\n            if (serverInfo.error) {\n                console.log(serverInfo.error);\n            } else {\n                console.log(\"game: \" + serverInfo.gameName);\n                console.log(\"server name: \" + serverInfo.serverName);\n                console.log(\"players: \" + serverInfo.numberOfPlayers + \"/\" + serverInfo.maxNumberOfPlayers)\n            }\n    });\n\nThis will connect to a server and split out ot the logs what game the server is playing, what the server name is listed as and how many people are playing on it.\n\nServer Info Object\n------------------\n\nThis object hems very closely to the [Valve's response format documentation](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Server_Queries#Reply_format_3).\n\n### error \n\nThis is used to check if there was an error talking to the server, it will be undefined if there were no problems, if it's populated it'll be a error message.\n\n### version\n\nVersion, as far as I can tell it's always 49.\n\n### serverName\n\nThis is what the server's name is listed as. It corresponds to the hostname attribute in server.cfg, but is not a network hostname.\n\n### map\n\nCurrent map.\n\n### gameDirectory\n\nGame directory, can be used to determine what game is being played.\n\n### gameName\n\nA nicer representation of the game name, extracted from the value for gameDirectory.\n\n### gameDescription\n\nThe game description returned by the server, it's generally slightly less than acurate.\n\n### applicationId\n\nSteam application id. See [this page](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Application_IDs) if you're interested in learning more.\n\n### numberOfPlayers\n\nCurrent number of players on teh server.\n\n### maxNumberOfPlayers\n\nMaximum (visible) number of players.\n\n### numberOfBots\n\nNumber of bots currently running around on ther server.\n\n### dedicatedServer\n\nIf the server is a dedicated server or not.\n\n### operatingSystem\n\nHost operating system of the server. 'l' for Linux, 'w' for Windows.\n\n### passwordRequired\n\nBoolean to say if the server requires a password.\n\n### secure\n\nBoolean to say whether is VAC secured or not.\n\n### gameVersion\n\nCurrent version of the game the server is running.\n\n### hostname\n\nThis is just echoed back from the request.\n\n### port\n\nThis is just echoed back from the request.\n",
